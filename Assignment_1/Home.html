      <h1>Welcome to My AltSchool World</h1>
      <p>
        I'm <b>Emehinola Sunday</b> by name, an AltSchool Africa student with student
        ID: <strong>ALT/SOE/023/2216</strong> I'm a Quantity Survey graduate from University of
        Lagos and I currently work as a Microsoft Azure support engineer with
        TekExpert. I'm a friendly, curious and very open minded person that
        likes to explore, make friends, network and learn in every possible way
        I can think of.
      </p>

      <h1>My AltSchool Goals</h1>
      <p>
        I signed up on AltSchool Africa to develop my IT skills and network with
        people of like minds, I'm on the Cloud track and the journey so far has
        been great. As a newbie in tech, I've been able to familiarize myself
        with the basics of web development and basic programming and I can't
        wait to continue on this journey to learn more, build and expand my
        knowledge in cloud computing engineering. I'm passionate about
        technology and development and I look forward to being the best I can be
        and begin to work with greater brands in the industry as a Cloud and
        DevOps engineer.
